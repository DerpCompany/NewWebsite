    <h2>Winter Event</h2>
    <p>
    Merry Derpmas! Tis the season for a warm cup of your favorite liquid, your official Derp Company ugly sweater, and sitting down to play cozy games with friends in jolly merriment! However, sometimes the chills stay just a bit longer, the sun sets early and the forest grows dark with haunts and scares in our bi-annual Nightmare Before Derpmas event! Either way, don’t miss out on our big giveaways during these special holiday events.
